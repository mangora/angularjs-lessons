### Getting to know the JetBrains WebStorm IDE ###

####Hello people!####

We have come to the second part of the Angular.js lessons, where we will get to know the tools for doing Angular.js
development and proper project organization.


In very lesson, we will get to know WebStorm IDE and its Angular.js plugin.
Since this is a live preview lesson, there won't be any code here, but there will be an show-and-tell preview of
the WebStorm features which we will organize on a projector screen.

By far, WebStorm is the best JavaScript IDE currently available and it is one of the rare ones that has the Angular.js
plugin. (just to mention that the plugin was developed by John Lindquist)
I highly recommended it.

Even the Google guys behind Angular.js use WebStorm for development purposes and that is a fact that speaks for itself.

Anyway, if you have any questions, feel free to send an email.

Thanks.
